# CPEG470-CTF-BYO-SecurMisfig-

This site was created for my CPEG470 class, this website is a super simple and easy CTF problem, 
targeting security misconfiguration. Be sure to use the hints to solve this one if you get stuck!

The deployment site is having troubles: to see the site download the repository, run npm install, then npm run start, and test out the ctf flag on the local host.
